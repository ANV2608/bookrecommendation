# book-reccomendation
An AI-based book recommendation system suggests books based on user reading history, genres, authors, ratings, reviews, and TBR lists. It combines collaborative and content-based filtering, uses NLP and sentiment analysis on reviews, adapts to changing preferences, and handles cold-start problems, implemented in Python.
